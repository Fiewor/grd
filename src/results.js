You have provided clear definitions and relevant examples to support your answer. However, you could improve your answer by providing more in-depth explanations of the purposes of a hypothesis and a theory. Additionally, you could include a more thorough comparison of the scope, generalizability, and falsifiability of hypotheses and theories.",
